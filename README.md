You're absolutely right — we’re going **pro-mode** now. Let’s write a full-blown, copy-ready, **README.md** in markdown format with **detailed explanations** for everything. Think of this as a hybrid between a GitHub README and a walkthrough/guide for future you or a recruiter to see *you really know your stuff*.

## 🧠 What is PortWarden Lite?

**PortWarden Lite** is a simple, modular Python-based tool designed to monitor the open ports on a target system or server. It helps detect when new services start (or stop) running by scanning and comparing port states over time.

This is especially useful in:

- Home lab monitoring
- Penetration testing reconnaissance
- Learning how network services behave
- Understanding `nmap`, automation, and scripting in real-world security workflows

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

The project runs in **three major steps**, all tied together by a shell script:

```bash
+-------------------+         +--------------------+        +-------------------+
|   scanner.py      |  --->   |  portwatcher.py    | --->   |     alert.py      |
|  (does scan)      |         | (detect changes)   |        | (log + alerting)  |
+-------------------+         +--------------------+        +-------------------+
````

1. **`scanner.py`** — Uses Nmap to scan the target host and stores current open ports in `ports.json`.
2. **`portwatcher.py`** — Compares `ports.json` (current scan) with `prev_ports.json` (previous scan).
3. **`alert.py`** — Generates alerts for any ports that were added or removed, and stores history in `port_history.json`.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 **Real-time detection** of changes in open ports
* 📜 **History logging** for audit/tracking purposes
* 🧪 **Fully testable** as individual scripts
* 🛠️ **Shell script wrapper** for smooth automation
* 🕒 **Cron integration** for periodic scans
* 🧠 **Simple file-based memory** (no DB needed)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (On Kali Linux or Debian)

1. **Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PORTWARDEN_PROJECT.git
cd PORTWARDEN_PROJECT/
```

2. **Install Nmap if not installed:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
```

3. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 💥 Manual Usage

You can run the tool using the provided shell script:

```bash
bash src/run_portwarden.sh
```

Or, if you want to run individual parts for debugging:

```bash
python3 src/scanner.py
python3 src/portwatcher.py
python3 src/alert.py
```

Each time you run it:

* It scans the target host (you’ll be prompted for IP/domain)
* Saves the scan results
* Compares with the last scan
* Alerts you on any changes

---

## ⏰ Automate with Cron (Recommended)

To run the scanner automatically every 30 minutes:

1. Open crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

2. Add this line at the bottom:

```bash
*/30 * * * * /bin/bash /full/path/to/PORTWARDEN_PROJECT/src/run_portwarden.sh >> /full/path/to/PORTWARDEN_PROJECT/cron.log 2>&1
```

> 🧠 This ensures PortWarden runs quietly in the background and logs any changes.

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

> *A learning project turned into a real-world tool.*

This project was built from scratch to:

* Get hands-on with Python scripting for cybersecurity
* Learn how to integrate `nmap` programmatically
* Automate routine tasks using cron
* Showcase practical skills on GitHub

Whether you're new to infosec or a hacker-in-training, this tool helps solidify core concepts in recon, monitoring, and scripting.
